# Data Structures

## What are data structures?

A way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure that provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. Examples include List, Queue, and Map. Implementation of a List (DS) include Dynamic Aray and Linked List.

So the Data Structure defines <i>how</i> an abstract data type is implemented.
